# CHIP-8 Emulator

Daniel Villase√±or C.

## Installation

Make sure to first install the SDL graphics library.

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

Then compile the program using `make`.

## Execution

```bash
./chip8 <path/to/some/rom>
```

You can run the tests in the `tests/` folder, or play some games provided on the `roms/` folder. You can also search for compatible `.ch8` and use this emulator on them.
