# CHIP-8 Emulator

Daniel Villase√±or C.

## Installation

Make sure to first install the SDL graphics library.

```bash
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
```

Then compile the program using `make`.

## Execution

```bash
./chip8 <path/to/some/rom>
```

You can run the tests in the `tests/` folder, or play some games provided on the `roms/` folder. You can also search for compatible `.ch8` files and use this emulator on them.

## Debug mode

To activate debug mode during execution, press the `O` key.  
While in debug mode, press the `P` key to step through each instruction.

If you need the debug mode activated from the start of an execution, you can change the value of the `debug_mode` flag on `src/chip8/chip.c:25`.

## Input Keys

## Tests Status
